## Your JSON Payload (Fixed)

```json
{
    "email": "test@example.com",  // Replace with actual customer email
    "title": "Monthly Family Support",
    "description": "Monthly payments to family members",
    "frequency": "monthly",
    "receivers": [
        {
            "name": "Jane Doe",
            "phone": "778520941",
            "countryCode": "+256",
            "amountPerInstallment": 5000,
            "numberOfInstallments": 2
        },
        {
            "name": "Mike Smith",
            "phone": "705902042",
            "countryCode": "+256",
            "amountPerInstallment": 3000,

    ]
}
```

**Total Amount:** $16,240.00 (Jane: $10,000 + Mike: $6,000 + 1.5% processing fee: $240.00)

## Testing Instructions

### Method 1: Using Django Management Command
```bash
# Test with creating customer
python manage.py test_payment_plan --create-customer --email test@example.com

# Test with cleanup
python manage.py test_payment_plan --email test@example.com --cleanup
```

### Method 2: Using Test Script
```bash
# Validate payload first
python validate_payload.py

# Test API endpoint
python test_payment_plan.py
```

### Method 3: Using cURL
```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/api/payment-plans/" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "email": "test@example.com",
    "title": "Monthly Family Support",
    "description": "Monthly payments to family members",
    "frequency": "monthly",
    "receivers": [
        {
            "name": "Jane Doe",
            "phone": "778520941",
            "countryCode": "+256",
            "amountPerInstallment": 5000,
            "numberOfInstallments": 2
        },
        {
            "name": "Mike Smith",
            "phone": "705902042",
            "countryCode": "+256",
            "amountPerInstallment": 3000,
            "numberOfInstallments": 2
        }
    ]
}'
```

2. **Django Server Running:** Start with `python manage.py runserver`
3. **Database Migrations:** Ensure all migrations are applied
4. **API Endpoint:** Update URL in test scripts if different from `/api/payment-plans/`

## Model Context Improvements

1. **Proper Error Handling:** All database operations are wrapped in try-catch
2. **Data Validation:** Input validation before database operations
3. **Transaction Safety:** Rollback on partial failures
4. **Relationship Integrity:** Proper foreign key handling
5. **Status Tracking:** Better transaction status management
6. **Timestamp Management:** Proper created/updated/completed timestamps

All changes maintain backward compatibility while adding robustness for production use.
